# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends from 2009-2017

### Purpose

Determine how different campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals. The project includes creating and displaying visualization for **Outcomes Based on Launch Date** and **Outcomes Based on Goals**. The purpose of this data is to learn why some Kickstarters succeed and fail.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Succuessful campaigns for the theater category were the most volatile based on launch dates. The max value for successful campaigns occured in May and June (111 and 100). The minimum value for successful campaigns occured in December (37). This data shows that the most successful launch dates occur from April through July. This data also illustrates that canceled Kickstarters have little or no correlation with launch date. Failed Kickstarters follow a similar trend with successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There are some clear trends regarding campaign outcomes and the relation to campaign goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were challenges faced when organizing data for **Outcomes Based on Goals**, specifically referring to pledge data instead of goal data. This is was due to human error. Another challenge during the project was creating rows in the middle of the spreadsheet instead of adding at the end, ultimately creating incorrect referrences to rows.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
